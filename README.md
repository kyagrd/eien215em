## Textbook
 * Advanced Engineering Mathematics (5th ed. Int'l ed.) by Zill and Wright. ISBN 979-1-4496-8980-3. Jones & Bartlett.

## Software
Nowadays We have much more effective computing tools
than just using pencil and paper, especially for solving differential equations.
We still need to understand the basic underlying principles,
but once we have understood the principles use of the appropriate computing tools
greatly expedite finding a solution to mathematical problems.
You could use MATLAB, Mathematica, or Maple if you have a license.
However, there are also free, open source, and web-interfaced software
that does the job and some of them are becoming mature as they gain popularity among users.
Here are some of those freely aviliable software that could be helpful for this course
* Wolforam|Alpha https://www.wolframalpha.com/
  -- web based interface, basically free but some advanced features need to be purchaed
* http://mathstud.io/
  -- web based interface is free, mobile apps need to be purchased
* SageMath http://www.sagemath.org/
  -- free and open source
* Maxima http://maxima.sourceforge.net/
  -- free and open source
* GNU Octave https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/
  -- free and open source

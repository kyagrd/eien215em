# EIEN233(02) Engineering Mathematics I
This is the course hompage of Engineering Mathematics I (공업수학I) in Spring 2016 at Korea University Sejong Campus.
Since the lecture will be in English all course materials including Quiz and Exams are to be provided in English.
You may write in Korean, as well as in English, for the answers to the homework, quiz, and exam questions.

## Software
Nowadays We have much more effective computing tools
than just using pencil and paper, especially for solving differential equations.
We still need to understand the basic underlying principles,
but once we have understood the principles use of the appropriate computing tools
greatly expedite finding a solution to mathematical problems.
You could use MATLAB, Mathematica, or Maple if you have a license.
However, there are also free, open source, and web-interfaced software
that does the job and some of them are becoming mature as they gain popularity among users.
Here are some of those freely aviliable software that could be helpful for this course
* Wolforam|Alpha https://www.wolframalpha.com/
  * web based interface, free basic features
  * does not support worksheet/notebook like interface
  * paid advanced features (step-by-step walkthrough, interactive)
* Math Studio http://mathstud.io/
  * free web based worksheet/notebook interface
  * connects to Google Drive
  * paid Mac & mobile apps
* Maxima http://maxima.sourceforge.net/
  * free and open source
  * worksheet/notebook interface application
  * easy to install
* GNU Octave https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/
  * free and open source
  * worksheet/notebook interface application
  * easy to install
* SageMath http://www.sagemath.org/
  * free and open source
  * web based online worksheet/notebook interface
  * can install offiline but quite tricky (in Windows it needs virtualbox ...)
* http://slopefield.nathangrigg.net/
  * this one is good for drawing direction fields
